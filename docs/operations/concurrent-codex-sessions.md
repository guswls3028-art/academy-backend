# Concurrent Codex session workflow

This is the owning Academy contract for local work that spans multiple Codex
tasks. It prevents shared dirty trees, accidental cross-session staging, stale
deployment sources, and abandoned worktrees without weakening the production
continuity gates.

## Standing task authority

When a user assigns implementation, release, operations, or cleanup work, the
normal in-scope commit, push, PR, merge, messaging, deployment, production
mutation, and residue cleanup steps are already authorized. Do not pause for a
second approval at each step; record the exact source SHA, target, checks, and
readback instead. This does not broaden the task, make an ambiguous destructive
target safe, waive tenant or user-data protection, bypass a release window or
continuity gate, or replace an approval required by an external platform.

## Ownership model

- `C:\academy\backend` and `C:\academy\frontend` are canonical readback roots.
  Keep them on clean `main`; feature work does not edit them directly.
- Every task owns a unique lowercase session slug, branch, and worktree path.
  Cross-repository work uses the paired paths under
  `C:\academy\_worktrees\sessions\<session>\backend|frontend`.
- A worktree belongs to exactly one task. Other tasks may inspect it read-only
  but never stage, commit, reset, clean, rebase, or run generators in it.
- Exactly one task is the release owner. Other tasks stop at a reviewed branch
  or PR plus CI evidence and hand the exact commit SHA to the release owner.

The Git branch and registered worktree are the ownership record. Do not create
a parallel session registry, memory file, or shared scratch branch.

## Start a task

Choose a slug that combines the feature and a short task identifier, for
example `attendance-019fb78c`. From outside a target worktree run:

```powershell
pwsh C:\academy\backend\scripts\codex\session-worktree.ps1 `
  -Action Start `
  -Session attendance-019fb78c `
  -Repository both
```

`Start` fetches `origin/main` and creates a unique branch and worktree for each
selected repository. Use `backend`, `frontend`, or `both` to match the actual
scope. If a foreign dirty tree already exists, leave it untouched and still
start from current `origin/main` in the owned worktree.

Before editing, record the emitted base SHA and confirm the intended paths with:

```powershell
pwsh C:\academy\backend\scripts\codex\session-worktree.ps1 -Action Inspect
```

## Work and integration

- Run commands, generators, local servers, and tests only from the owned path.
  Use an explicit unique local port and point E2E at that server.
- Keep a cross-repository feature on paired branches with the same session slug.
- Before handoff, fetch and integrate current `origin/main` in the owned branch,
  resolve conflicts there, run focused checks, and report both exact SHAs.
- Never deploy a local-only commit, a dirty tree, a detached HEAD, or a branch
  that is not merged into current `origin/main`.
- A release owner records the chain `origin/main SHA -> candidate image digest
  or frontend version -> live runtime revision`. Backend deployment must also
  pass `scripts/v1/assert-production-source-freshness.ps1`; frontend deployment
  remains owned by `.github/workflows/quality-gate.yml` and its exact
  `GITHUB_SHA` readback.

## Finish or hand off

A task is not complete merely because existing changes were “preserved.” Pick
one explicit terminal state:

1. **Merged:** branch is contained in `origin/main`, or every remaining commit
   is patch-equivalent to `origin/main`; the worktree is clean and the session
   worktree and local branch are removed.
2. **Review pending:** clean committed branch/PR, named owner, exact SHA, and a
   stated merge or discard decision. It remains a worktree until resolved.
3. **Intentional WIP:** a named `wip/` branch with a recovery commit, owner, and
   next decision. It is never a deployment source. Raw uncommitted WIP is not a
   durable handoff state.

For the merged state, the close command performs a full preflight and refuses
dirty, foreign, or unmerged worktrees before deleting anything. A squash or
cherry-pick merge is accepted only when `git cherry origin/main HEAD` contains
no `+` commit; any unique commit preserves the branch:

```powershell
pwsh C:\academy\backend\scripts\codex\session-worktree.ps1 `
  -Action Close `
  -Session attendance-019fb78c `
  -Repository both
```

After active sessions and releases finish, fast-forward clean canonical roots:

```powershell
pwsh C:\academy\backend\scripts\codex\session-worktree.ps1 -Action Sync
```

`Sync` refuses dirty, non-`main`, or divergent canonical roots. It never resets,
rebases, force-checks out, or deletes user work.

## Verification

```powershell
pwsh scripts/codex/test-session-worktree.ps1
pwsh scripts/codex/session-worktree.ps1 -Action Inspect
git diff --check
git status --short
```

Final reporting lists canonical backend/frontend SHAs, the deployed revision or
digest when release work occurred, every remaining noncanonical worktree, and
the owner/decision for each unmerged or dirty branch.
