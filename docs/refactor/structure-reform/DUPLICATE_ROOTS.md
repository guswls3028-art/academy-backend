# Duplicate Roots

**Status:** [VERIFIED] code/path audit plus [PROPOSED] canonical candidates  
**Captured:** 2026-05-22  
**Scope:** student-centered duplicate roots and adjacent high-risk paths

Risk scale:

- P0: tenant/data-loss/security risk
- P1: high user-visible drift or operational incident risk
- P2: medium drift or refactor blocker
- P3: cleanup/documentation risk

| Frontend submissions API/types wrappers | `[COMPLETED]` Admin submissions type and materials submissions API paths plus the teacher submissions API path are compatibility facades over the shared submissions contract; student submit and teacher submissions inbox import shared directly | Admin submissions/materials submissions, teacher submissions inbox, student submit page | `src/shared/api/contracts/submissions` | Role-app imports of admin submissions internals removed for this surface | P2 | `[DONE]` focused ESLint, typecheck, build, focused teacher/admin submissions E2E, boundary snapshot 3→1 |
| Frontend lecture sections API wrapper | `[COMPLETED]` Admin lecture sections API path is now a compatibility facade over the shared lecture sections contract; teacher clinic imports shared directly | Admin lecture section management, admin clinic section filters/create, admin session clinic tab/block, teacher clinic create sheet | `src/shared/api/contracts/lectureSections` | Last role-app import of admin lecture section internals removed | P2 | `[DONE]` focused ESLint, typecheck, focused teacher/admin clinic E2E, boundary snapshot 1→0 |
| Frontend enrollment API wrappers | `[COMPLETED]` admin lectures, exams, homework, clinic tab, and teacher score entry previously depended on role-local wrappers for `/enrollments/session-enrollments/` | Lecture score roster, exam creation/enrollment panel, homework assignment/enrollment panel, session clinic tab, teacher mobile score entry | `frontend/src/shared/api/contracts/sessionEnrollments.ts` with admin compatibility facades | Lectures/exams/homework session enrollment API files remain compatibility facades; active call sites now use shared contract where cross-domain import was unnecessary | P2 | `[DONE]` focused ESLint, frontend typecheck, boundary snapshot 43→41 |

## Canonicalization Order

1. Introduce selectors for reads and replace non-students direct reads only when
   tests cover the caller.
2. Introduce services for create/update/lifecycle and route existing views
   through them without changing URLs.
3. Add deprecation logging for legacy paths before removal.
4. Converge frontend role-app APIs onto a shared contract after backend schema
   snapshots exist.
5. Remove legacy helpers only after route usage detection proves no caller
   remains.

## Required Explicit Findings

- Student creation/restoration is actually 6+ roots.
- Student profile update is actually 3 primary roots plus schedule visibility
  mutations.
- Password/account recovery is actually 4 API roots and must not be mixed with
  the current release while Phase 1 student canonicalization starts.
- The E2E lecture/session path used `/api/v1/students/students/`, not the current
  `/api/v1/students/`; the known tracked caller has been migrated.
- `noPhone/uses_identifier/omr_code`, `active/is_managed`, and parent initial
  password have semantic drift across backend and frontend.

## Implemented Convergence Notes

- 2026-05-23: Student Excel/import row orchestration converged on
  `apps.domains.students.services.import_students_from_rows` and
  `resolve_student_import_row`. Student-only Excel worker and lecture-enroll
  Excel now share tenant-scoped name+parent duplicate detection, deleted-student
  restore, school-level validation, phone/ps_number/omr derivation, and
  `create_student_account` graph creation without the worker depending on the
  `lecture_enroll` helper. `bulk_from_excel.py` and `lecture_enroll.py` remain
  compatibility facades. Teacher mobile Excel upload now opens a bottom sheet
  to confirm initial password and welcome AlimTalk flag instead of silently
  uploading with hardcoded `0000`.
- 2026-05-23: Production Excel worker QA completed. The QA pass also removed a
  DRF action route converter bug in `students/excel_job_status/<job_id>/` and
  a parser heuristic that dropped valid rows when a name exceeded 20
  characters despite a valid phone.
- 2026-05-23: JSON `bulk_create` and `bulk_resolve_conflicts` now route through
  the student import service. Active duplicate detection, delete-and-recreate,
  parent password notice mapping, and rollback-on-create-failure are covered by
  local tests and production API QA.
- 2026-05-22: Phase 2 enrollment matrix and assignment roster writes/read
  scope now converge through `apps.domains.enrollment.selectors` and
  `apps.domains.enrollment.services.lifecycle`.
- 2026-05-22: Phase 3 automatic notification queue payloads carry
  source/use-case/domain object/actor metadata for operational tracing.
- 2026-05-22: Phase 4 AI job gateway rejects missing tenant/source and
  payload tenant mismatch before SQS publish.
- 2026-05-22: Phase 5 first cleanup removed the known
  `/api/v1/students/students/` E2E helper route.
- 2026-05-22: Phase 5 frontend enrollment API cleanup created a canonical
  `app_admin/domains/enrollment/api/enrollments.ts` client. Lectures, exams,
  and homework session-enrollment wrappers now delegate to it instead of each
  normalizing the same endpoint independently.
- 2026-05-22: Session-enrollment fetch/bulk contract moved to
  `src/shared/api/contracts/sessionEnrollments.ts`. Admin enrollment remains a
  compatibility facade, lecture scores/exam creation/session clinic/teacher
  mobile score entry call the shared contract directly, and the previous exams
  `404/501 -> []` compatibility is preserved in the shared contract.
- 2026-05-22: Frontend CI runs `pnpm guard:legacy-api` to fail on reintroduced
  legacy `/students/students/`, `/lectures/enrollments/`, or direct
  `/enrollments/` create calls in tracked `src`/`e2e` TypeScript/JavaScript.
- 2026-05-22: Frontend shared purity slice moved theme, responsive view,
  clinic-target, video status/workbox, and session-progress contracts under
  `src/shared/*`. Admin role paths remain compatibility facades where needed;
  `shared -> app_*` imports became 0 and cross-app/admin role imports became 37.
- 2026-05-22: Operational notification counts moved to shared notification
  contracts/hooks. Admin notification modules are compatibility facades, teacher
  surfaces use `useTeacherPendingCounts`, and cross-app/admin role imports are
  now 30.
- 2026-05-22: Community post/reply/attachment contracts moved to shared
  community contracts. Student notices/community and teacher developer feedback
  no longer import admin community internals, patch notes are shared product
  data, and cross-app/admin role imports are now 24.
- 2026-05-22: Video access-mode/rule contracts moved to shared video contracts,
  reusable thumbnail rendering moved to `src/shared/media/video`, student video
  surfaces no longer import admin video internals for those contracts, and
  cross-app/admin role imports are now 21.
- 2026-05-22: Lecture/session attendance API moved to shared attendance
  contracts. Admin attendance API remains a compatibility facade, teacher
  attendance and lecture matrix surfaces use the shared contract directly,
  duplicate teacher matrix/export calls were removed, and cross-app/admin role
  imports are now 17.
- 2026-05-22: Storage/inventory API, student API contracts, and student Excel
  utilities moved to shared contract/product modules. Admin paths remain
  compatibility facades, teacher/student storage and student surfaces use shared
  contracts directly, and cross-app/admin role imports are now 9.
- 2026-05-22: Fees API and status/tone contracts moved to shared
  contract/product modules. Admin paths remain compatibility facades, teacher
  fees surfaces use shared contracts directly, local E2E uses a route-level
  feature-flag override only, and cross-app/admin role imports are now 7.
- 2026-05-22: Tools timer download API moved to the shared tools contract.
  Admin stopwatch timer API remains a compatibility facade, teacher timer uses
  the shared contract directly, and cross-app/admin role imports are now 6.
- 2026-05-22: Exam enrollment API moved to the shared exam enrollment contract.
  Admin exam enrollment API remains a compatibility facade, teacher exam detail
  and OMR pages use the shared contract directly, and cross-app/admin role
  imports are now 4.
- 2026-05-22: Tenant information API moved to the shared tenant info contract.
  Admin profile API re-exports the contract, teacher organization settings uses
  shared directly, and cross-app/admin role imports were 3 after that slice.
- 2026-05-22: Submission types and submission inbox/action APIs moved to the
  shared submissions contract. Admin submissions/materials API paths and the
  teacher submissions API path remain compatibility facades, student submit and
  teacher submissions inbox use shared directly, and cross-app/admin role
  imports were 1 after that slice.
- 2026-05-22: Lecture section and section-assignment APIs moved to the shared
  lecture sections contract. Admin lectures sections API remains a compatibility
  facade, teacher clinic imports shared directly, and cross-app/admin role
  imports are now 0.
- 2026-05-23: Parent welcome-password drift cleanup also aligned account
  Alimtalk queue metadata. Direct student welcome and registration approval
  paths now enqueue `registration_approved_student|parent` event metadata so
  `NotificationLog` masking and operations tracing use the same SYSTEM_AUTO
  trigger SSOT.
- 2026-05-23: Student restore lifecycle converged on
  `apps.domains.students.services.restore_student`. `bulk_restore`,
  `bulk_resolve_conflicts`, and lecture/enrollment deleted-student reuse now
  share ps_number unmangling, collision rejection, user reactivation,
  membership restoration, and parent relinking behavior without reactivating
  previous enrollments.
- 2026-05-23: Student permanent delete entrypoints converged on
  `apps.domains.students.services.permanently_delete_students`.
  `bulk_permanent_delete`, `bulk_resolve_conflicts` delete, deleted-duplicate
  cleanup, and 30-day purge now share tenant-scoped locking, fee/section FK
  cleanup, user retention checks, pending reset cleanup, and orphan account
  deletion. The remaining structural debt is replacing the service's guarded
  raw SQL graph with domain-owned cleanup hooks/events.
- 2026-05-23: Account recovery temporary password usability converged on
  `apps.core.services.password.TEMP_PASSWORD_LENGTH = 6`. Public login recovery
  still uses `/auth/account-recovery/dispatch/` and pending reset semantics,
  `NotificationLog` keeps credential bodies redacted, and production QA verified
  a successful real AlimTalk send plus cleanup. Device-visible body validation is
  pending user paste because logs intentionally do not store the secret body.
- 2026-05-23: Student creation account graph converged on
  `apps.domains.students.services.create_student_account`. Direct create, JSON
  bulk create, conflict delete-and-recreate, registration approval, lecture
  enrollment import, and student Excel worker now share Parent ensure, User
  creation/password assignment, Student creation, and active student
  `TenantMembership` creation. Validation, duplicate/deleted-student policy,
  response shape, and message dispatch intentionally remain at each caller until
  their orchestration contracts are snapshotted. Frontend teacher create now
  calls the shared student contract, admin Excel upload passes the
  `send_welcome_message` flag through the worker payload, and the worker parses
  string booleans explicitly instead of treating `"false"` as truthy.
- 2026-05-23: Registration approval orchestration converged on
  `apps.domains.students.services.approve_registration_request`. Approve,
  bulk_approve, and auto-approve now share the same row lock, pending-state
  guard, signup password hash transfer, `pending -> approved` transition, and
  student account graph call. Approval notification dispatch remains outside
  the durable transaction and failures are logged without hiding the committed
  approval from the API caller.
- 2026-05-23: Parent account welcome-password drift reduced. Parent creation
  paths now use `ensure_parent_account_for_student()` result metadata, so new
  parent accounts announce `parent_initial_password(phone)` while existing
  parent accounts announce `변경되지 않음`. Student conflict restore no longer
  sends a new-password welcome message because restore does not reset passwords.
- 2026-05-22: Clinic participant/session/idcard active-student reads moved to
  `students.selectors` and `enrollment.selectors` for touched HTTP paths.
  `student_app.permissions.get_request_student` now returns only active
  tenant-scoped students, and tests cover deleted-student rejection through
  `student`, `enrollment_id`, student self-booking, and idcard fallback.
- 2026-05-22: Attendance roster create student validation moved from direct
  `Student.objects` lookup to `students.selectors`, and `AttendanceSerializer`
  now scopes session/enrollment FK querysets by request tenant. Tests cover
  cross-tenant, mixed-tenant, same-tenant deleted student rejection, and FK
  queryset scoping.
- 2026-05-22: Attendance production QA passed after deployment:
  `e2e/teacher/attendance-contract.spec.ts`, the deep operational smoke
  "강의 출결 매트릭스" path, API/console error capture, and mobile screenshots
  for teacher attendance check and matrix render.
- 2026-05-22: Messaging manual send and manual notification preview recipient
  reads moved to `messaging.services.recipients`, backed by
  `students.selectors.students_for_tenant(deleted="active")`. Tests cover
  student vs parent target phone, duplicate ID dedupe, same-tenant deleted
  student omission, cross-tenant omission, public preview redaction, and token
  payload raw phone preservation for sendable recipients.
- 2026-05-22: Messaging production QA passed after deployment without external
  send: production manual notification preview resolved a no-parent-phone
  active student once despite duplicate/missing IDs, returned no preview token,
  excluded the recipient for "전화번호 없음", and exposed no raw phone or
  replacement payload fields. The admin message page production smoke and
  mobile screenshot also passed with no console/API errors.
- 2026-05-22: Results admin student grades now parses `student_id` safely and
  uses `students.selectors.active_student_by_id` before enrollment/result reads.
  Tests cover malformed IDs, active same-tenant empty payload, cross-tenant
  rejection, same-tenant soft-deleted rejection, and the existing achievement
  contract.
- 2026-05-22: Results production QA passed after backend deployment
  (`8b7f0f24`, CI run `26296381780`, CI build note `83cf2554`) and frontend
  mobile follow-up deployment (`2d340855`, CI run `26299809665`). Production API
  checks covered active student `200`, malformed `student_id` `400`, and missing
  student `404`. Production UI checks covered the admin student detail overlay
  and grade tab smoke (`2 passed`) plus mobile visual capture at
  `C:\academy\_artifacts\results-prod-qa-20260522\admin-student-detail-grades-mobile-content-first-prod.png`.
  During QA, the mobile overlay asset/layout defect was fixed in frontend
  commits `756e6e3c`, `c4546fcf`, and `2d340855`; Cloudflare Pages upload
  resilience was fixed in `cf6f873b` and `8c428447`.
- 2026-05-22: Student soft delete side effects moved to
  `apps.domains.students.services.soft_delete_student`. The canonical service
  marks the student deleted, preserves unique `ps_number` semantics, unlinks
  parent, deactivates the login user and tenant membership, and delegates
  enrollment/clinic side effects to domain lifecycle hooks. `destroy` and
  `bulk_delete` are now route-level facades over that service. Local validation
  covered the full student test file (`24 passed`), stabilization/permanent
  delete/profile suites (`30 passed`), all student test modules (`85 passed`),
  `manage.py check`, and migration dry-run.
