Single Source of Truth for video access mode resolution.

- Default: FREE_REVIEW (unlimited review, no monitoring, no DB session/event writes)
- PROCTORED_CLASS: Only for students with Attendance.status == "ONLINE" for that session
  - First watch = class substitute: strict policy + monitoring + audit
  - After completion (VideoProgress.completed OR VideoAccess.proctored_completed_at):

- Offline students: majority, never monitored
